1\. Delete unnecessary files.

2\. Convert PNG images to JPG format. We like PNG because it supports transparency. But for those images without transparency, the size of png is
twice of jpg file. I converted PNG files to JPG and reduced the app size from 17MB to 9MB.

3\. For the universal app, iPad version could reuse retina @2x images.
