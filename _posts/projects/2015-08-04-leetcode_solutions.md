###About
`leetcode_solutions` is a set of my solutions to the programming challenges at [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com), implemented in C++. 

##SPOILER ALERT!!!
##You should try at leetcode.com first. Look at my solutions only when you can't figure it out.

###About LeetCode
There are many interesting programming challenges at LeetCode. Several programming languages are allowed. After you submitted a good solution, LeetCode shows you this solution's performance comparing to other people's solutions. In most cases, the speed order of the programming languages at LeetCode is C, C++, python, c#, javascript, java.

###Compile and Run
I compile the code with LLVM clang in the command line on Mac OS X. No Xcode or Visual Studio projects provided. If you need them, you can easily create an empty project and add files. Sorry for it. (Actually this is a side project when I learn VIM. I wanted to pratice something in VIM. You can copy the code in .h file and paste into leetcode.com. Don't forget to remove the namespace in the code.

After you install LLVM clang and cmake, you can follow the steps to compile and run in the command line.

1. `cmake CMakeLists.txt`
2. `make`
3. `./make`
